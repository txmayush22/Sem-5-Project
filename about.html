      <h3>"Greetings and a very warm welcome to Sunbeam Science Educare !"</h3>
      <p></p>
      Stellar accomplishments expand the frontiers of knowledge and scholarship every day. In this era of
      Globalization of education the obvious focus is on the quality of education. There is no single yardstick of
      quality. A good educational institution strives continuously for sustenance and enhancement of quality in every
      field of its activity.
      <p></p>
      As Sunbeam Science Educare works diligently to realize its mission of providing the best learning, teaching and
      opportunities to students and academicians alike, it continues to supply students with the basics of modern
      knowledge and high values.
      <p></p>
      This learning process would lead to the inventions and then to discoveries. We actively seek to engage our
      adjacent associates from research and educational institutions, to contribute in the process of learning by
      sharing their proficiency and practices gained outside of the classroom.
      <p></p>
      We are trusted to nurturing juvenile minds and preparing them for challenges in today’s globalised Institute. The
      doors of our faculty members are always open for any student who seeks help. We persuade all the students to use
      their time with professors and teaching staff fruitfully, to develop their own proficiency.
      <p></p>
      The research activities of our faculty lead to an extraordinary enrichment of the experience of our students.
      The experience to the students education that simply cannot be duplicated in the classroom. Our students learn
      the joy as well as the rigours of new discovery, and acquire skills of inquiry, evaluation, and communication
      that provide a foundation for the next phases of their careers and lives.
      <p></p>
      Amongst student's creativity, collective work and competition domestically, regionally and internationally
      thrive. I would ask you to take advantage of this great opportunity and join us
      in our endeavor to actively contribute to the overall improvement of this increasingly globalized society.
      <p></p>
      “For everyone of us that succeeds, its because there’s somebody there to show you the way out” we’re one of them.
      <p></p>
      We welcome you, here to a world of learning in enjoyable ways, to a world where every student is challenged to
      grow beyond his/her potential.
